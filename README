About CloudSizzle
=================

CloudSizzle is a social study planner for Aalto University students. Students
can create a study plan, share it to their friends, enroll to courses, invite
friends to courses and utilize the social networks to collaboratively work on
assignments in exercise groups and talk about course related matters in
discussion channels.

CloudSizzle is created on top of Aalto Social Interface (ASI). It gathers
course related information from Noppa and WebOodi and aggregates it in order to
create a mashup service for students. Smart-M3 RDF store is used as a
middleware for aggregating data and achieving loose coupling between the
services that are used for the mashup.

CloudSizzle is part of the OtaSizzle research project that is coordinated by
Helsinki Institute of Information Technology (HIIT).
