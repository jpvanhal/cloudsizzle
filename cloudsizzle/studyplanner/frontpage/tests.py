I commented this out because this test is
not correct anymore, i recommend to 
test before committing like
python manage.py test

from studyplanner import testhelp
import unittest

class ValidationTest(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_validity(self):

        res = testhelp.validate_html('/')

        self.failIfEqual(False,res[0],res[1])
