====================
Smart-M3 experiences
====================

Bugs:
1. XML special characters cause smart-m3 discard the triplet
2. Anything resembling namespace (with ":") causes smart-m3 to crash if the
namespace is not defined
3. Wildcard removals do not exist even though API documentation claims so.

Documentation:
1. WQL is not documented. Apart from Ora Lassilas PhD thesis. And that does
not contain the syntax used by smart-m3
